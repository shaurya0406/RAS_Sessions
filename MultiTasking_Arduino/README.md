# Write Code for Given Task

1. LED1 on for 1 sec and off for 1sec
2. LED2 on for 2 sec and off for 2 sec
3. LED3 its on for only 500ms and off for 1 sec
4. LED4 on for 1500ms and off for 2000ms

Choose the IO Pins for the LEDs on your own.

All the LEDs should be on when the Arduino boots up and then maintain their timings.
